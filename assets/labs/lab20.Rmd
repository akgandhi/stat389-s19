Today we are going to look at image classification from 10 classes of images.

Once this is downloaded, you'll have to run something like in the notes to
construct the training data and build a prediction model. Try a few things
with the dataset before moving on... Can you use a different transfer model
or grab a different internal layer? How does that influence the predictions?

**For this lab, just upload the Rmd file rather than your predictions**

## Run transfer learning and get predictions
