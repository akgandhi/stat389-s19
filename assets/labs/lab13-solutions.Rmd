## The randomForest and xgboost packages

We will need two new packages today. You can install it with:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if (!require(xgboost))
{
  install.packages("xgboost")
}
if (!require(randomForest))
{
  install.packages("randomForest")
}

library(xgboost)
library(randomForest)
```

## Simulation with randomForest

I think it is useful to do some simulations with trees to get a better grasp
on exactly how they are using the data to do predictions. Let's make a simulated
dataset with 10k points and a data matrix with just two columns. The two columns
are sampled uniformily in $[0,1]$. The output variable y will be 1 when the first
variable is larger than the second and 0 otherwise.

```{r}
n <- 10000
X <- matrix(runif(n * 2), ncol=2)
y <- as.numeric(X[,1] > X[,2])
```

The code below fits a very simply random forest model. The most only has a single
split (maxnodes = 2 gives a single split with two outputs), always considers both
variables (so the only randomness is the sample of data used), and only uses one
tree. This is basically a decision tree on a random subset of the training data.
The plot shows the predictions using color and puts a dot any misclassified data
points. You can run this without making any changes:

```{r}
model <- randomForest(X, factor(y), mtry = 2, maxnodes = 2, ntree = 1)
pred <- predict(model, newdata = X)

df <- tibble(y = y, x1 = X[,1], x2 = X[,2], pred = pred)

df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x1, x2)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = pred)) +
    geom_point(color = "black", size=0.2, data = filter(df, pred != y)) +
    geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0)
```

Rerun the same block of code a few times. Notice that (1) the split tends to be around
0.5 and (2) sometimes a split on x1 is used and sometimes a splint on x2 is used. Make
sure you understand both of these conditions.

Now, copy the code above in the block below. Change the maximum number of nodes to
three and observe what the output looks like. Run it a couple of times to see the
variation in each output. Can you deduce what the decision tree looks like each
time?

```{r}
model <- randomForest(X, factor(y), mtry = 2, maxnodes = 3, ntree = 1)
pred <- predict(model, newdata = X)

df <- tibble(y = y, x1 = X[,1], x2 = X[,2], pred = pred)

df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x1, x2)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = pred)) +
    geom_point(color = "black", size=0.2, data = filter(df, pred != y)) +
    geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0)
```

Copy the code below once more. Change maxnodes to 5 and observe how
the tree is trying to estimate the line with slope one and intercept zero.
Increase the maxnodes again to 20 and take note of how well this model
does compared to the simplier trees.

```{r}
model <- randomForest(X, factor(y), mtry = 2, maxnodes = 20, ntree = 1)
pred <- predict(model, newdata = X)

df <- tibble(y = y, x1 = X[,1], x2 = X[,2], pred = pred)

df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x1, x2)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = pred)) +
    geom_point(color = "black", size=0.2, data = filter(df, pred != y)) +
    geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0)
```

Copy the code one more time. Set maxnodes back to 2, but increase ntree
to 3 and run the code a few times. You'll see that sometimes it looks like
a single split and sometimes it looks like two splits. What is going on?

```{r}
model <- randomForest(X, factor(y), mtry = 2, maxnodes = 2, ntree = 3)
pred <- predict(model, newdata = X)

df <- tibble(y = y, x1 = X[,1], x2 = X[,2], pred = pred)

df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x1, x2)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = pred)) +
    geom_point(color = "black", size=0.2, data = filter(df, pred != y)) +
    geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0)
```

## Flights dataset

The dataset for this lab is a collection of domestic flights within
the U.S. during the year 2013. There are quite a large number of rows
(400k) but a limited number of columns. Some of the most important columns,
however, are categorical with a large number of values.

```{r, message=FALSE}
flights <- read_csv("https://github.com/statsmaths/ml_data/blob/master/flights_small.csv?raw=true")
ocol <- ncol(flights)
flights
```

Below I want you to use five different approaches to predict whether a flight
will be delayed. Each time, produce (1) the mis-classification rate on the training
and validation sets and (2) where applicable, produce a summary of what variables
are most important in the prediction model. Generally, just use all of the variables,
though you'll have a bit more freedom to experiment with what terms to smooth and
interact together in the GAM. I have kept from specifying some of the exact details.
Play around with what seems to work best... also, make sure you are saving the script
frequently in case something crashes!

1. Fit an elastic net model using cross-validation:

```{r}
X <- model.matrix( ~ -1 + ., data = flights[,seq(4, ocol)])
y <- flights$delayed

X_train <- X[flights$train_id == "train",]
y_train <- y[flights$train_id == "train"]

model <- cv.glmnet(X_train, y_train, family="binomial")

pred <- as.numeric(predict(model, newx = X) > 0)
sqrt(tapply((flights$delayed == pred)^2, flights$train_id, mean))
```

It will also be useful to see what the most important variables in the model are:

```{r}
B <- coef(model, s = model$lambda[5])
B[B[,1] != 0,,drop=FALSE]
```


2. Fit a KNN model:

```{r}
X <- model.matrix( ~ -1 + ., data = flights[,seq(4, ocol)])
y <- flights$delayed

X_train <- X[flights$train_id == "train",]
y_train <- y[flights$train_id == "train"]
X_valid <- X[flights$train_id == "valid",]
y_valid <- y[flights$train_id == "valid"]

for (k in c(3, 10, 25, 50, 100))
{
  pred_valid <- FNN::knn(X_train, X_valid, y_train, k=k)
  print(sqrt(mean((pred_valid == y_valid)^2)))
}
```

3. Fit a GAM:

```{r}
library(mgcv)

model <- gam(delayed ~ origin + dest + s(dep_hour, arr_hour, distance),
             data = flights,
             family = binomial(),
             subset = train_id == "train")

pred <- as.numeric(predict(model, newdata = flights) > 0)

sqrt(tapply((flights$delayed == pred)^2, flights$train_id, mean))
```

4. Fit a random forest model:

```{r}
flights2 <- flights
flights2$origin <- factor(flights2$origin)
flights2$dest <- factor(flights2$dest)
flights2$carrier <- factor(flights2$carrier)

model <- randomForest(factor(delayed) ~ month + weekday + arr_hour + dep_hour + origin + dest + distance + carrier,
                      data = flights2,
                      subset = train_id == "train",
                      ntree = 100, maxnodes = 15)

pred <- as.numeric(predict(model, newdata = flights2)) - 1L

tapply(flights$delayed == pred, flights$train_id, mean)
```

5. Fit a gradient boosted tree:

```{r}
X <- model.matrix( ~ -1 + ., data = flights[,seq(4, ncol(flights))])
y <- flights$delayed

X_train <- X[flights$train_id == "train",]
y_train <- y[flights$train_id == "train"]
X_valid <- X[flights$train_id == "valid",]
y_valid <- y[flights$train_id == "valid"]

data_train <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_train, label = y_train)
data_valid <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X_valid, label = y_valid)

watchlist <- list(train=data_train, valid=data_valid)

model <- xgb.train(data = data_train,
                   max_depth = 5, eta = 0.003, nthread = 2,
                   nrounds = 100,
                   objective = "binary:logistic",
                   watchlist = watchlist,
                   verbose=1, print_every_n=10, early_stopping_rounds = 100)
```

```{r}
importance_matrix <- xgb.importance(model = model)
importance_matrix
```

## Best solution

Now, as with last time, build the best possible model you can to
predict the output. Feel free to make use of the validation set
to fit the final model (this is certainly not a requirement, just
a suggestion).

```{r}

```

## Submitting your solutions

Finally, once you have your predictions saved as a variable called `pred`,
run the following code to produce your your results:

```{r}
submit <- select(flights, obs_id, train_id)
submit <- mutate(submit, pred = pred)
write_csv(submit, "class13_submit.csv")
```

Now, upload the csv file to GitHub and you are done.
