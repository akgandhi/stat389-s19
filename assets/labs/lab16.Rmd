# Set-up

Read in the following libraries and to load the metadata about
the flowers:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

crimes <- read_csv("https://statsmaths.github.io/ml_data/chi_crimes_5.csv")
```

The names of the crimes are, in order:

```{r}
c("criminal_damage", "narcotics", "prostitution", "robbery", "theft")
```

Make sure that your predictions are either `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` or `5`.

# Submission

The code below assumes that you have added a prediction named
`pred` to every row of the dataset.

```{r}
submit <- select(f17, obs_id, train_id)
submit <- mutate(submit, pred = pred)
write_csv(submit, "class14_submit.csv")
```

Now, upload the csv file to GitHub and you are done.
