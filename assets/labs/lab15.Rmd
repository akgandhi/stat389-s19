# Set-up

Read in the following libraries and to load the metadata about
the flowers:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(glmnet)

tract <- read_csv("https://statsmaths.github.io/ml_data/tract_median_income.csv")
ocol <- ncol(tract)
```

Your task is to predict the median income of each tract based on the other
demographic features in the tract using neural networks

# Todays lab

Similar to other labs, we will start by trying some of the other models that
we have seen so far. I think the two most reasonable are the elastic net and
gradient boosted trees. Try to fit an elastic net on the dataset here and
report the RMSE on the training and validation sets:

```{r}

```

Now, try to fit a gradient boosted tree and
report the RMSE on the training and validation sets:

```{r}

```

## Neural network

Finally, let's try to build a neural network for this dataset (Note: it does
not actually make a lot of sense to use a neural network here; we will see
better examples over the next week as we go back to image processing). Make
sure that you have keras installed:

```{r}
library(keras)
```

Construct the dataset, keeping in mind that we need to scale the dataset
before passing it to keras (I have done this for you already):

```{r}
X <- scale(model.matrix( ~ -1 + ., data = tract[,seq(4, ocol)]))
y <- tract$median_income

X_train <- X[tract$train_id == "train",]
X_valid <- X[tract$train_id == "valid",]
y_train <- y[tract$train_id == "train"]
y_valid <- y[tract$train_id == "valid"]
```

Then, build a neural network using keras:

```{r}

```

Compile the model:

```{r}

```

And fit the model

```{r}

```

Finally, prediction on the dataset and see how well it performs:

```{r}

```

Try to play around with some of the values in the network (learning rate,
number of epochs, number of layers, sizes of the layers) to see how they
effect the final model.


# Best model

Finally, re-run the best model here, run the final chunk, and upload your
results to GitHub:

```{r}

```

# Submission

The code below assumes that you have added a prediction named
`pred` to every row of the dataset.

```{r}
submit <- select(tract, obs_id, train_id)
submit <- mutate(submit, pred = pred)
write_csv(submit, "class15_submit.csv")
```

Now, upload the csv file to GitHub and you are done.
