## GitHub and GitHub Classroom

I have decided that for the second half of this course it
will make more sense to go use GitHub classroom over google
forms to deal with submission of homework. I have modified
the syllabus to make this clear. For each class, you must
submit estimated predictions for datasets that we are working
with on GitHub prior to the next class. 

If you do not already have an account, go to the main webpage and create a
free account. Try to pick a professional name as you may find that you want
to make this public at some point:

- [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

Next, follow this link and accept the invitation:

- [https://classroom.github.com/a/p1kW2tFv](https://classroom.github.com/a/p1kW2tFv)

Assuming you have a valid GitHub account, this will set up a
repository for you to use for the remainder of the semester.
